# How to effectively use this resource

Blank question papers and model solutions for exams and quizzes held in previous years is provided here. This resource can be used for self assessment as well as preparation for examinations or interviews.

**DO NOT** immediately access contents of the `model solutions` directory -- this resource is not meant to be used to learn question-answer pairs by rote. Instead, this resource is meant to allow students who have studied concepts of machine learning to assess their preparation and understanding of the subject matter.

1. First, pick a blank question paper from the directory `blank_question_papers`.
2. There are subdirectories, each corresponding to a different offering of the course. Subdirectory names are of the form `XXXX-YY-Z` where `XXX-YY` denotes the academic year of the offering and `Z` denotes the semester (I for the autumn semester, II for the winter semester and III for the summer semester)
3. The name of the files can help you choose the question paper. All files in this directory have names of the form `AA.pdf` which conveys the type of the question paper. `Qn` where `n` is a number indicates a quiz (Q1 is held before Q2 etc), `MS` indicates a mid-semester exam, and `ES` indicates an end-semester exam
4. Make a sincere attempt to solve the questions yourself. If you are a beginner, you may start with Q1 or MS question papers since they focus on preliminary concepts. Do not worry if you are unable to solve all questions. Solve as many as you can.
5. Once you have completed your attempt, pick up the corresponding model solution from the  `model_solutions` directory. Subdirectories and files in that directory have the same naming structure as those in the `blank_question_papers` directory except that they have the phrase `_key` in their filenames to indicate that they are model solution files.
6. Check your solution and ruminate on the principles behind solving the question in case you did not get the solution correct.
7. Please keep in mind that there may be more than one way to solve a particular question and the model solutions do not necessarily list all the possible ways.
8. Discuss with your friends, tutors or instructors if you have doubts about a particular concept or question.
